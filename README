mirrord

A configurable repository mirroring daemon.

1. Configure the frequency and relative time of day to sync with a repository.

2. Choose which type of repository to mirror (ubuntu, debian, arch). For
example, this will be able to handle multiple underlying protocols for syncing.

3. Other things to be added later :)
